One evening a family gathered on their patio for a barbecue only to look up and see a figure drifting silently above them. He hovered just beyond their reach his expression hidden by shadows giving no hint of his intentions. They watched him both frightened and fascinated as he simply floated unmoved by the familys reactions. The next day Floater was gone as mysteriously as hed arrived leaving the family with only questions and a lasting sense of unease about the quiet man who hovered without a sound.",
